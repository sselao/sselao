## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Stephen Selao and I'm a software developer living in the beautiful city of Montreal, Canada.**

First and foremost, I love writing code!

I am currently working as a Software Developer at Discotech, a startup based in Los Angeles. My journey as a freelance web developer began about 10 years ago when PHP was one of the most popular web languages.

I currently work with Python, JavaScript (TypeScript), and React. I'm a curious person and avid learner by nature: I'm obsessed with learning new languages and frameworks.
