# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Stephen Selao, Software Developer living in the beautiful city of Montreal, Canada.**

First and foremost, I love writing code!

I currently work with JavaScript/TypeScript, and React.

My journey as a freelance web developer began about 10 years ago when PHP was one of the most popular web languages. I'm a curious person and avid learner by nature: I'm obsessed with learning new languages and frameworks.
