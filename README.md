# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Stephen Selao, Software Developer living in the beautiful city of Montreal, Canada.**

First and foremost, I love writing code!

I currently work with JavaScript/TypeScript, and React.

My journey as a freelance web developer began about 10 years ago when PHP was one of the most popular web languages. I'm a curious person and avid learner by nature: I'm obsessed with learning new languages and frameworks.

Over the years, I've built different side projects to learn new languages and frameworks. In my spare time, I often gravitate towards building games.

### [Sushi Clicker (React, TypeScript)](https://github.com/sselao/sushi-clicker) *in development*

Sushi Clicker is a clicker game (incremental game) built entirely with React.

Multi-Room Interactive Board Game:
Codenames is a popular board game I recreated. Multiple game rooms can be played simultaneously and players can connect to a game room to play with friends. The backend API server is responsible for handling the multiple game states.
