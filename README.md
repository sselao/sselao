# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Stephen Selao, Software Developer at Discotech, living in the beautiful city of Montreal, Canada.**

First and foremost, I love writing code!

I currently work at [Discotech](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/discotech), a startup based in Los Angeles. I am responsible for:

* Converting [Discotech's current web app](https://app.discotech.me/) to a modern JS framework
* Improving the UI
* Optimizing for Google search results

My journey as a freelance web developer began about 10 years ago when PHP was one of the most popular web languages. I currently work with Python, JavaScript (TypeScript), and React.

I'm a curious person and avid learner by nature: I'm obsessed with learning new languages and frameworks.
